# Event Management System

## Overview

The Event Management System is a web application built with Django that allows users to create, manage, and participate in events. This project demonstrates proficiency in Django's features, including user authentication, payment processing, media handling, and third-party integrations. The application is designed to provide a seamless experience for both event organizers and participants.

## Features

### User Authentication & Authorization
- **Registration & Email Confirmation**: Users must register and confirm their email address before accessing their profile.
- **Profile Management**: Logged-in users can edit their profile, view their created events, and see the status (Pending, Approved, or Rejected) of each event.
- **Password Reset**: Users can reset their password. This feature is available for both logged-in and non-logged-in users.

### Event Management
- **Event Creation**: Users can create events, which are submitted for admin approval. Events can have one of three statuses: Pending, Approved, or Rejected.
- **Event Approval System**: Admins can approve or reject events. Approved events are visible to everyone, while rejected events are only visible to the event creator in their profile.
- **Homepage Countdown**: The homepage displays the 3 most upcoming approved events, each with a countdown timer.

### Ticket Management
- **Ticket Purchase**: Logged-in users can purchase tickets for events using Stripe for payment processing. After purchasing, a QR code is generated for each ticket.
- **QR Code Generation**: Each purchased ticket generates a QR code, which can be viewed in the userâ€™s profile under the "Purchased Tickets" section.

### Admin Features
- **Event Approval/ Rejection**: Admins have the ability to approve or reject events created by users, ensuring that only suitable events are listed on the platform.
